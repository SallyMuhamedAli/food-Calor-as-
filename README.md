# Introduction
Provide a brief introduction to the project, explaining the motivation behind developing a calorie calculator model and the potential benefits it can offer.

# Data Preprocessing
Describe the steps you took to preprocess the data, including:

. Setting up the working environment
. Reading and understanding the dataset
. Handling missing values, if any
. Performing feature engineering, such as creating new derived features
# Exploratory Data Analysis
 Discuss the exploratory data analysis (EDA) you conducted, such as:

. Using the describe() method to get statistical insights about the data
. Visualizing the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships
# Model Development
Explain the model development process, including:

. Splitting the data into training and testing sets (80:20 split)
. Applying the Linear Regression algorithm
. Evaluating the model's performance
# Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the developed model, such as:

. Importing the necessary modules
. Loading the trained model
. Passing new data to the model for calorie prediction
Interpreting the model's output
